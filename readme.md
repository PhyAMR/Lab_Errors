# Lab error app

Inthis repository I will be creating an app to calculate the propagation of the error given any formula. 

This is a common task in physics lab classes during collegue that takes a few minutes to calculate the error of the formula, but then you have to create a table for the report
and it can make up to 1 hour of your time.

Hope this will be halpful for someone.
